# js-hello-world-challenge
Challenge yourself to print "Hello, World!" without the (direct) use of numbers, strings or console.log!

The rules are simple:

1. you cannot use string literals (e.g. `"Hello, World!"`)
2. you cannot use number literals (e.g. `65`)
3. you cannot use the function `console.log`, or any function that would output to stdout
4. you have to output the string `"Hello, World!"` to stdout
5. the shorter the code the better
